## Description
Task: Next.js Assessment - Blog Application

## Tech stacks
-  [Next.js - 15](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)

## Approach Overview
### 1. Component-Driven Design
- Each UI element, such as the navbar, dropdown, or post list, is implemented as a reusable component.
- This promotes modularity, making the application easier to maintain and extend.

### 2. State Management with Context API
- Global states, like selected hashtags or search queries, are managed using Reactâ€™s Context API.
- Eliminates prop-drilling, ensuring state accessibility across the component tree.

### 3. Dynamic Filtering
- A hashtag-based filtering mechanism dynamically displays posts.
- Posts are filtered in-memory using JavaScript's `filter` function.
- `useMemo` optimizes performance by recalculating filtered posts only when hashtags change.

### 4. Tailwind CSS for Styling
- Tailwind CSS simplifies the creation of responsive, utility-based styles.
- Dynamic classes enable conditional styling for dropdowns, buttons, and hover effects.

### 5. Static Generation with `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths`
- Individual post detail pages are statically generated at build time.

### 6. Dynamic Routing
- Dynamic routes, such as `/posts/[id]`, are utilized for individual post pages.
- These routes are defined within the file structure (e.g., `pages/posts/[id].js`).

### 7. API Integration
- Data fetching is implemented using:
- `getServerSideProps` for real-time data fetching.
- `getStaticProps` for static data fetching during build time.
